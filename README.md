# MolDecod: Transformer for molecule generation

MolDecod is a 5M-parameter decoder-only transformer using rotary positional encoding, for SMILES molecule generation.

## Repository

This repository contains:
- MolDecod PyTorch dictionary and its tokenizer in `/models`
- A `streamlit.py` app to interact with the model
- A `TechnicalReport.md` for technical details
- Notebooks to train, evaluate and use the model in `/notebooks`
- Utils functions in `/utils`

## Model characteristics

ðŸ“– [TechnicalReport.md](https://github.com/tonito9/MolDecod-molecule-generation-transformer/blob/main/TechnicalReport.md)

MolDecod is a decoder-only transformer model (GPT-like) using rotary positional encoding, with a model dimension of 256, 4 attention heads, and 4 decoder layers. This results in ~5 million parameters.

It was trained on ~2.7M molecules (~90M tokens), from the high-quality MOSES and ChEMBL datasets [[+]](https://tdcommons.ai/generation_tasks/molgen/), and achieves an impressive performance for its size.

MolDecod comes with its custom tokenizer, a SentencePiece model trained on the same dataset.

On 10,000 generated molecule for different levels of temperature, it obtains the following metrics:
| Temperature | Validity | Uniqueness | Diversity | Novelty | KL Divergence | Fragment Similarity | Scaffold Diversity |
|-------------|----------|------------|-----------|---------|---------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 0.1         | 1.00     | 0.04       | 0.76      | 0.9455  | 6.4742        | 0.0545              | 0.0148             |

## App

Launch the streamlit app to interact with the model. Download the repo, open a terminal window, install the requirements and run the following command:
```
streamlit run streamlit.py
```

You can generate molecules from a prompt and visualize their structure and properties.
